    <h3 id="summary-title-1">Summary for those who don’t want to watch the whole video</h3>
    <p id="summary-paragraph-1">In this episode of "Beyond the Bag," the host addresses a common question among newcomers to loose leaf tea: 
      how to steep it effectively. They introduce four different methods for brewing delicious loose leaf tea, with 
      a promise to reveal their personal favorite by the end of the video. The host emphasizes that by following 
      these techniques, viewers will become skilled at steeping tea.</p>
    <p id="method-teapot-1">The first method highlighted is using a teapot, which often comes with a built-in infuser. The host demonstrates 
      how to add loose leaf tea, fill the teapot with hot water, and let it steep for the recommended time. They also 
      provide an alternative for teapots without infusers by using a tea strainer. This method allows the tea leaves to 
      steep freely before serving, making it perfect for multiple cups.</p>
    <p id="method-tea-ball-1">Next, the host introduces the tea ball, a reusable metal mesh infuser ideal for single servings. They explain how 
      to load loose tea into the ball and steep it in a cup. Although tea balls are great for personal servings, they may 
      not hold enough tea for larger quantities. The host encourages tea lovers to add this tool to their collection.</p>
    <p id="method-french-press-1">The video also features the French press as an unconventional but effective method for steeping loose leaf tea. 
      The host describes how to use the French press to steep tea, emphasizing its versatility and ability to adjust 
      serving sizes. Finally, they discuss tea filters, which offer a convenient way to steep tea with easy cleanup. 
      After summarizing the four methods, the host invites viewers to share their favorite tea-making techniques in the comments.</p>

    <h3 id="matcha-title-1">Matcha tea</h3>
    <img id="matcha-image-1" src="media/image/matcha_powder_2.jpg" alt="Powdered scoop of green matcha">
    <p id="matcha-history-1-1">During the Tang dynasty (618–907) in China, tea leaves were compressed into bricks for storage and trade, with 
      the preparation process described in Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea." This involved roasting the compressed tea, 
      grinding it, and boiling it with water and salt, sometimes adding ingredients like ginger and green onions. The 
      Song dynasty (960–1279) saw a shift towards whisking powdered tea with hot water, marking the early origins of 
      what would later become matcha. Notable texts from this period, such as Cai Xiang's "Record of Tea," detail the 
      meticulous process of preparing high-grade lump tea and the use of whisks to create the beverage.</p>
    <p id="matcha-history-1-2">In the Song dynasty, the quality of tea was highly emphasized, with tea ceremonies evolving to reflect new ideals 
      of flavor that focused on aroma and smoothness, moving away from the natural bitterness of tea. The complex production 
      methods required for lump tea made it expensive and exclusive, often criticized for overshadowing the tea’s original qualities. 
      Various techniques were developed to achieve a desirable white color in the tea, further complicating the production process.</p>
    <p id="matcha-history-1-3">The Ming dynasty (1368–1644) marked a significant change when Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang banned the production of compressed tea 
      in 1391. This shift led to the popularization of loose leaf tea, which was steeped in hot water—a method closer to modern tea 
      brewing. Historical accounts indicate that during this time, prized teas were still prepared using older methods, but the ban 
      resulted in the decline of both compressed tea and matcha production in China. The transition also reflected the emperor's preferences 
      for simplicity over the refined complexities of previous tea practices.</p>
    <p id="matcha-history-1-4">Consequently, the evolution of tea preparation in China shifted towards methods that prioritized accessibility and practicality, 
      paving the way for matcha's development in Japan, where it would be adapted to fit Japanese cultural aesthetics and tea rituals. 
      This transformation highlights the interplay between social, cultural, and agricultural influences on tea production throughout Chinese history.</p>
